## Go from C++:

In this short talk, we will see together the main differences between C/C++
and Go. Basic knowledge of C or C++ is preferable, though not mandatory, in
order to follow. Through a review of the differences between those languages,
we will see how to adapt our state of mind in order to be efficient in Go.

The points raised will be:

 - fast review of the similarities between C/C++ and Go
 - syntactical differences
 - conceptual differences:
   - memory management
   - reflection
   - OOP concepts in Go?
   - concurrency
   - ecosystem
